<ul>
<li><p>Enumerations in Swift are different from their popular counterparts in C-like languages. Rather that containing &quot;one of a set of integer values&quot; like most C-like languages, Swift&#39;s enumerations can be thought of as holding one named type of a given set of named types.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To clarify: Rather than holding an integer value that has been pre-defined integer value (Error = -1, Success = 0) an enumeration in Swift only associates a name with a type (like Int, String, Tuple, etc.) These elements of the enumeration can then be assigned &quot;Associated Values.&quot; For example, an enumeration can store an &quot;Error&quot; which is a Tuple with an Int value for the error code and a String containing the message. Each time a function or piece of code assignes or returns an Error(Int, String), it can set populate the Tuple with Int/String par for the specific error condition.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Alternative to the enumeration storing named types, Swift enumerations can have a type. If that type is Int, then they will behave more like their C-style counterparts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Here is the simple enumeration.</p>
<p>Unlike their C counterparts, the members of the enumeration below are not integer values (0, 1, 2, etc.) Instead, each member is a fully-fledged value in its own right.</p>
