    <h2 id="downcasting">Downcasting</h2>
<p>As with other languages, downcasting refers to casting an object to a subclass within its hierarchy. This is done with the Type Cast Operator, &quot;as&quot;.</p>
<p>Because not all objects can be downcasted, the result of a downcast may be nil. Because of this, we have two options for downcasting. We can downcast to an optional using the &quot;as?&quot; operator or downcast with forced unwrapping of the optional with the standard &quot;as&quot; operator. As with forced unwrapping, only do this if you know for certain that the downcast will succeed.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see this in action using optional binding and the &quot;as?&quot; operator. Remember that our library has type MediaItem[], so if we cast an element of that array to either a Movie or Song, will will be downcasting the instance.</p>
