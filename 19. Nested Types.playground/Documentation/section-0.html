<p>Let&#39;s take a look at how we might define a Blackjack Card using nested types.</p>
<p>Each card has a suit (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs) and a rank (Ace, King, Queen, etc.) This is a natural use of nested types because the suit and rank enumerations only apply to a Blackjack card and so they are scoped to within that that type.</p>
<p>Additionally, since the rank of an Ace can be valued at either an 11 or a 1, we can create a nested structure within the Rank enumeration that allows us to multiple values for a given rank.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see how this might be implemented:</p>
