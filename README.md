===========

Learn Apple's Swift programming language interactively through these playgrounds.

###Target Audience

  Programmers familiar with C++ and/or Objective-C.

###What you'll need

  You will need XCode 8.2 GM (or later) and a Mac to run it on.

###Purpose & Goal

  More than a primer, these playgrounds are intended to get programmers up to
  speed on Swift as fast as possible so they can begin using Swift productively.

  These playgrounds only cover the language. They do not dig into the Swift 
  Standard Library or other APIs.

  To increase your understanding, you are encouraged to experiment with them
  along the way. Play the 'what-if' game. These are live playgrounds which offer
  near-realtime feedback of edits.

###Source of Content

  I created these while working my way through the "Language Guide" section of
  Apple's book, "The Swift Programming Language". I feel the information from
  that section is represented here fairly completely and very concisely. Many
  of the samples come directly from the book. Some portions from the book's
  "Language Reference" section were also included where I felt a bit more
  information was helpful.

  If you don't already have the book, it's free. You should probably get it.

###Contributors

  Thanks to Rafał Wójcik for his quick work to update these playgrounds to
  incorporate the Swift language changes that came with XCode 7.
  
  Most  playgrounds updated to Swift 3 by Christopher Bell.
