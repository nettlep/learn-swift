<ul>
<li>Assuming knowledge of C here, so a lot will be left out that is the the same, such as &quot;let i = 1 + 2&quot;</li>
<li>Unary operators work on a single target. Of them, you have prefix operators such as !b or postfix operators such as i++.</li>
<li>Binary operators work on two targets and are infix operators because they go between two values, such as a + b</li>
<li>Ternary operators work on three targets. There is only one ternary: a ? b : c.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We have our standard assignment operator (=). Note that the assignment operator in Swift does
not actually return a value, so the statment &quot;if (x = y) {}&quot; will not work. This helps prevent
accidental assignments during conditionals.</p>
