    <h2 id="property-observers">Property Observers</h2>
<p>Property observers allow us to respond to changes in a property&#39;s value. We can declare an observer that contains our code that is run just before a property is set (optionally allowing us to alter the value being set) and an observer that is run just after a property has been modified.</p>
<p>Property observers are available for global as well as local variables.</p>
<p>These observers are not called when a property is first initialized, but only when it changes.</p>
<p>Similar to setters, each &#39;willSet&#39; and &#39;didSet&#39; will receive a parameter that represents (in  the case of &#39;willSet&#39;) the value about to be assigned to the property and (in the case of &#39;didSet&#39;) the value that was previously stored in the property prior to modification.</p>
