<p>A Lazy Stored Property is a value that is not calculated until its first use.</p>
<p>They are declared using the &quot;lazy&quot; attribute and may not be constant.</p>
<p>Global and local variables are all lazy, except that they don&#39;t need the lazy attribute.</p>
<p>Here, we&#39;ll define a couple classes to showcase Lazy Stored Properties. In this example, let&#39;s assume that DataImporter is a time-consuming process, and as such, we will want to use a lazy stored property whenever we use it. This way, if we end up never using it, we never pay the penalty of instantiating it.</p>
