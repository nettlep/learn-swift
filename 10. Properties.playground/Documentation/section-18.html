    <p>The following structure includes a computed property with a Point type named &#39;center&#39;. Notice that &#39;center&#39; is variable (not constant) which is a requirement of computed properties.</p>
<p>Every computed property must have a getter, but does not need a setter. If we provide a setter, we need to know the new value being assigned to the computed property. We&#39;ve called this value &#39;newCenter&#39;. Note that this value does not have a type annotation because the computed property already knows that it is a Point type. Providing a type annotation would be an error.</p>
