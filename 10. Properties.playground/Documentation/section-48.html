<p>Until now, we&#39;ve been working with Instance Properties and Instance Methods, which are associated to an instance of a class, structure or enumeration. Each instance gets its own copy of the property or method.</p>
<p>Type properties are properties that are attached to the class, structure or enumeration&#39;s type itself and not any specific instance. All instances of a type will share the same Type Property.</p>
<p>These are similar to &#39;static&#39; properties in C-like languages.</p>
<p>For Value types (structs, enums) we use the &#39;static&#39; keyword. For Class types with the &#39;class&#39; keyword.</p>
<p>Type properties can be in the form of stored properties or computed properties. As with normal stored or computed properties, all the same rules apply except that stored type properties must always have a default value. This exception is necessary because the initializer (which we&#39;ll learn about later) is associated to a specific instance and as such, cannot be reliable for initializing type properties.</p>
<p>Here is a class with a couple of type properties</p>
