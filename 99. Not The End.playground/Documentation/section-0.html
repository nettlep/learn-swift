<p>These playgrounds are taken directly from the Language Guide section of Apple&#39;s book titled &quot;The Swift Programming Language&quot;.</p>
<p>The book also includes a Language Reference, which discusses the language in a more terse form with greater detail (including the grammar.) It&#39;s not as dry as reading the C++ Ansi Spec, but it&#39;s still rather detailed. In fact, some of the information from these playgrounds came from the Language Reference section.</p>
<p>The good news is that having managed to get through these playgrounds, you&#39;ll probably find the Language Reference to be rather quick reading, chock full of additional goodies that you never knew about (because the Language Guide and these Playgrounds don&#39;t touch on.)</p>
<p>For example, how would you code the assert function such that the first parameter is executed and evaluated to a Bool for use in determining an error condition?</p>
