    <p>At this point, we have two instances that still exist in memory, but cannot be cleaned up because we don&#39;t have any references to them in order to solve the problem.</p>
<h2 id="resolving-strong-reference-cycles-between-class-instances">Resolving Strong Reference Cycles between Class Instances</h2>
<p>Swift provides two methods to resolve strong reference cycles: weak and unowned references.</p>
<p>Weak references allow an instance to be held without actually having a strong hold on it (and hence, not incrementing the reference count for the target object.)</p>
<p>Use weak references when it&#39;s OK for a reference to become nil sometime during its lifetime. Since the Apartment can have no tenant at some point during its lifetime, a weak reference is the right way to go.</p>
<p>Weak references must always be optional types (because they may be required to be nil.) When an object holds a weak reference to an object, if that object is ever deallocated, Swift will locate all the weak references to it and set those references to nil.</p>
<p>Weak references are declared using the &#39;weak&#39; keyword.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s fix our Apartment class. Note that we only have to break the cycle. It&#39;s perfectly fine to let the Tenant continue to hold a strong reference to our apartment. We will also create a new Tenant class (we&#39;ll just give it a new name, &quot;NamedTenant&quot;), but only so that we can change the apartment type to reference our fixed Apartment class.</p>
