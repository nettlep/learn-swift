<ul>
<li>Automatic Reference Counting allows Swift to track and manage your app&#39;s memory usage. It automatically frees up memory from unused instances that are no longer in use.</li>
<li>Reference counting only applies to classes as structures and enumerations are value types.</li>
<li>Whenever a class instance is stored (to a property, constant or variable) a &quot;strong reference&quot; is made. A strong reference ensures that the reference is not deallocated for as long as the strong reference remains.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can&#39;t really see ARC in actino within a Playground, but we can still follow along what would normally happen.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll start by creating a class to work with</p>
