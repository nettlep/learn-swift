<p>We&#39;ve covered two common scenarios of cyclic references, but there is a third case. Consider the case of a country and its capital city. Unlike the case where a customer may have a credit card, or the case where an apartment may have a tenant, a country will always have a capital city and a capital city will always have a tenant.</p>
<p>The solution is to use an unowned property in one class and an implicitly unwrapped optional property in the other class. This allows both properties to be accessed directly (without optional unwrapping) once initialization is complete, while avoiding the reference cycle.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see how this is done:</p>
