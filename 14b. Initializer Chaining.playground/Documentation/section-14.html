    <p>For individual properties, we can set their default value with a closure or function instead of just a literal value.</p>
<p>In the example below, we use a closure to calculate the default value for &#39;estimatedPi&#39;. Note the parenthesis at the end of the closure. Without them, we would be asking to set &#39;estimatedPI&#39; to a closure type rather than to the result of the closure. Also, the parenthesis tell it to execute the closure immediately.</p>
<p>Also note that these closures used for default values for properties are not allowed to access any of the other properties of the class because it&#39;s assumed that they have not yet been initialized.</p>
