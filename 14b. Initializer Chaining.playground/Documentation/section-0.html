<ul>
<li>Initializer Chaining refers to the way in which initialization takes place along the class hierarchy.</li>
<li>Designated Initializers are those that are responsible for ensuring that the instance of a class, structure or enumeration is properly initialized. These are the initializers you&#39;ve seen so far. Designated initializers are also resonsible for calling the superclass&#39; initializer.</li>
<li>Convenience Initializers are initializers that are provided for specialized initialization and must call one of the designated initializers within a class in order to fulfill the requirement of properly initializing a class.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Designated Initializers are the normal initializers (&quot;init(...)&quot;) functions that you&#39;ve seen so far. If the system creates an initializer for you, it will be a designated initializer.</p>
<p>Convenience Initializers allow you to offer different code-paths through initialization, which call upon the designated initializers to do the heavy lifting. They use the keyword &quot;convenience&quot;. They are actually different than designated initializers because Swift uses the difference (designated vs. convenience) to perform two-phase initialization, which we&#39;ll cover shortly.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what a simple case looks like with a designated and convenience initializer:</p>
