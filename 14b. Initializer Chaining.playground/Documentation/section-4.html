<p>Two-phase initialization is a new concept enforced by Swift. Think of it like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Subclasses MUST FIRST initialize any stored properties that are part of their subclass. They must do this before they are allowed to cusomize a super&#39;s stored property. Subclasses MUST THEN call the super&#39;s initializer, which will repeat this process until the top-most superclass (the base class) is reached.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point we can assume that the class is fully initialized (but not necessarily customized by the subclasses that may need to alter the initialization results.</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase 2: In the base class&#39; initializer, we can customize its properties before it returns to the caller (a subclass.) That subclass is then allowed to write to any/all stored properties defined by itself or the superclass chain. This continues until you get the the bottom-most subclass.</li>
</ul>
<p>A note about convenience initializers:</p>
<p>Convenience initializers must always call into a designated initializer from the current class. A designated initializer for a subclass must then into a super&#39;s iniitializer, which may also be a convenience initializer, because that convenience initializer will be required to eventually call a designated initializer before going higher up the chain.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s derive a class from Food so we can see this in action:</p>
