# Initializer Chaining

## Things to know:

- Initializer Chaining refers to the way in which initialization takes place along the class hierarchy.
- Designated Initializers are those that are responsible for ensuring that the instance of a class, structure or enumeration is properly initialized. These are the initializers you've seen so far. Designated initializers are also resonsible for calling the superclass' initializer.
- Convenience Initializers are initializers that are provided for specialized initialization and must call one of the designated initializers within a class in order to fulfill the requirement of properly initializing a class.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Designated Initializers are the normal initializers ("init(...)") functions that you've seen so far. If the system creates an initializer for you, it will be a designated initializer.

Convenience Initializers allow you to offer different code-paths through initialization, which call upon the designated initializers to do the heavy lifting. They use the keyword "convenience". They are actually different than designated initializers because Swift uses the difference (designated vs. convenience) to perform two-phase initialization, which we'll cover shortly.

Here's what a simple case looks like with a designated and convenience initializer:
```swift
class Food
{
	var name: String

	// Designated initializer - required as the class does not have a default value for 'name'.
	// There can be more than one of these, but the fewer the better, usually, design-wise.
	init(name: String)
	{
		self.name = name
	}
	
	// Here, we'll use a convenience initializer to initialize 'name' to an unnamed Food
	convenience init()
	{
		// Must call the designated in same class
		self.init(name: "[unnamed]")
	}
}
```

Here we make use of our two initializers
```swift
let namedMeat = Food(name: "Bacon")
let mysteryMeat = Food()
```

## Two-Phase Initialization

Two-phase initialization is a new concept enforced by Swift. Think of it like this:

- Phase 1: Subclasses MUST FIRST initialize any stored properties that are part of their subclass. They must do this before they are allowed to cusomize a super's stored property. Subclasses MUST THEN call the super's initializer, which will repeat this process until the top-most superclass (the base class) is reached.

At this point we can assume that the class is fully initialized (but not necessarily customized by the subclasses that may need to alter the initialization results.

- Phase 2: In the base class' initializer, we can customize its properties before it returns to the caller (a subclass.) That subclass is then allowed to write to any/all stored properties defined by itself or the superclass chain. This continues until you get the the bottom-most subclass.

A note about convenience initializers:

Convenience initializers must always call into a designated initializer from the current class. A designated initializer for a subclass must then into a super's iniitializer, which may also be a convenience initializer, because that convenience initializer will be required to eventually call a designated initializer before going higher up the chain.

Let's derive a class from Food so we can see this in action:
```swift
class RecipeIngredient: Food
{
	var quantity: Int
	
	// This is a designated initializer (because it has no 'convenience' keyword)
	init(name: String, quantity: Int)
	{
		// We must initialize our new stored properties first (this is Phase 1)
		self.quantity = quantity
		
		// Next, we must call super's initializer (still, Phase 1)
		super.init(name: name)
		
		// Only after the super's initializer is called, can we customize any properties that
		// originated from someplace up the class hierarchy chain.
		self.name = "Ingredient: " + name
	}

	// Here, we'll create a convenience initializer that simply provides a default quantity
	// value of 1. Note that in order for this to compile, we are required to call a designated
	// initializer.
	convenience override init(name: String)
	{
		self.init(name: name, quantity: 1)
	}
}
```

Now we can call our various initializers to see them in action:
```swift
let oneMysteryItem = RecipeIngredient()
let oneBacon = RecipeIngredient(name: "Bacon")
let sixEggs = RecipeIngredient(name: "Eggs", quantity: 6)
```

## Inheriting a full set of the super's initializers

In the following class, we don't specify any initializer, but that's OK because we have default values for the stored property (purchased).

Not providing any initializer at all allows us to gain a full set of the super's initializers.
```swift
class ShoppingListItem: RecipeIngredient
{
	var purchased = false
	var description: String
	{
		var output = "\(quantity) x \(name)"
		output += purchased ? " ✔" : " ✘"
		return output
	}
}
```

Let's initialize our new ShoppingListItem using the super's initializer
```swift
let lotsOfCheese = ShoppingListItem(name: "cheese", quantity: 99)
```

Here, we can create an array of ShippingListItems
```swift
var breakfastList = [
	ShoppingListItem(),
	ShoppingListItem(name: "Bacon"),
	ShoppingListItem(name: "Eggs", quantity: 6),
]
```

For individual properties, we can set their default value with a closure or function instead of just a literal value.

In the example below, we use a closure to calculate the default value for 'estimatedPi'. Note the parenthesis at the end of the closure. Without them, we would be asking to set 'estimatedPI' to a closure type rather than to the result of the closure. Also, the parenthesis tell it to execute the closure immediately.

Also note that these closures used for default values for properties are not allowed to access any of the other properties of the class because it's assumed that they have not yet been initialized.
```swift
class ClassWithPI
{
	let estimatedPI: Double =
	{
		let constant1 = 22.0
		let constant2 = 7.0
		
		// Must return the type specified by the property
		return constant1 / constant2
	}()
}
```

Here's a more pracitcal example. Note that since the closure is required to return the type of the property it is initializing, it must create a temporary of the same type which is initialized and then returned.
```swift
struct CheckerBoard
{
	let boardColors: [Bool] =
	{
		var temporaryBoard = [Bool]()
		var isBlack = false
		for i in 1...10
		{
			for j in 1...10
			{
				temporaryBoard.append(isBlack)
				isBlack = !isBlack
			}
			
			isBlack = !isBlack
		}
		
		// Return the temporary in order to set 'boardColors'
		return temporaryBoard
	}()
	
	func squareIsBlackAtRow(row: Int, column: Int) -> Bool
	{
		return boardColors[(row * 10) + column]
	}
}
```

We can now check our work
```swift
var board = CheckerBoard()
board.squareIsBlackAtRow(1, column: 1) // Should be false
board.squareIsBlackAtRow(1, column: 2) // Should be true
```
