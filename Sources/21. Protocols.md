# Protocols

## Things to know:
- Protocols define a required set of functionality (including methods and properties) for a class, structure or enumeration.
- Protocols are "adopted" by a class, structure or enumeration to provide the implementation. This is called "conforming" to a protocol.
- As you should already be aware, protocols are often used for delegation.
- Protocol Syntax looks like this:
	
	protocol FirstProtocol
	{	
		// protocol definition goes here
	}

- Protocol adoption looks like this:

	struct SomeStructure: FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol
	{
		// structure definition goes here
	}

	class SomeClass: SomeSuperclass, FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol
	{
		// class definition goes here
	}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Property requirements
- A protocol can require the conforming type to provide an instance of a property or type property.
- The protocol can also specify if the property must be gettable or gettable and settable. If a protocol only requires a gettable property, the conforming class can use a stored property or a computed property. Also, the conforming class is allowed to add a setter if it needs.
- Property requirements are always declared as variable types with the 'var' introducer.

Let's take a look at a simple protocol. As you'll see, we only need to define the properties in terms of 'get' and 'set' and do not provide the actual functionality.
```swift
protocol someProtocolForProperties
{
	// A read/write property
	var mustBeSettable: Int { get set }
	
	// A read-only property
	var doesNotNeedToBeSettable: Int { get }
	
	// A type property always uses 'class'. This is the case even if adopted by a structure or
	// enumeration which will use 'static' when conforming to the protocol's property.
	class var someTypeProperty: Int { get set }
}
```

Let's create a more practical protocol that we can actually conform to:
```swift
protocol FullyNamed
{
	var fullName: String { get }
}
```

A structure that conforms to FullyNamed. We won't bother creating an explicit getter or setter for the 'fullName' property because Swift's defaults will suffice.
```swift
struct Person: FullyNamed
{
	var fullName: String
}

let john = Person(fullName: "John Smith")
```

Let's try a more complex class
```swift
class Starship: FullyNamed
{
	var prefix: String?
	var name: String
	init(name: String, prefix: String? = nil)
	{
		self.name = name
		self.prefix = prefix
	}
	
	var fullName: String
	{
		return (prefix != .None ? prefix! + " " : "") + name
	}
}
```

In the class above, we use a 'name' and an optional 'prefix' to represent the full name, then provide a computed value to fulfill our 'fullName' requirement.

Here it is in action:
```swift
var ncc1701 = Starship(name: "Enterprise", prefix: "USS")
ncc1701.fullName
```

## Method Requirements

Similar to property requirements, the protocol only defines the method type, not the implementation.

Variadic parameters are allowed, but default values are not.

Method requirements can be mutating - simply use the 'mutating' keyword before the function definition. Note that when conforming to the protocol, only classes are required to use the 'mutating' keyword when conforming to the protocol, following the normal procedure.

As with property requirements, type methods are always prefixed with the 'class' keyword.

Here's a simple example that defines the requirements for a 'random' function which takes no parameters and returns a Double:
```swift
protocol RandomNumberGenerator
{
	func random() -> Double
}
```

Let's adopt this protocol:
```swift
class LinearCongruentialGenerator: RandomNumberGenerator
{
	var lastRandom = 42.0
	var m = 139956.0
	var a = 3877.0
	var c = 29573.0
	func random() -> Double
	{
		lastRandom = ((lastRandom * a + c) % m)
		return lastRandom / m
	}
}
let generator = LinearCongruentialGenerator()
generator.random()
generator.random()
generator.random()
```

## Protocols as Types

Protocols are types, which means they can be used where many other types are allowed, including:

- As a parameter to a function, method or initializer
- As the type of a constant, variable or property
- As the type of items in an Array, Dictionary or other container

Here's a protocol used as a type. We'll create a Dice class that stores a RandomNumberGenerator as a constant so that it can be used to customize the randomization of the dice roll:
```swift
class Dice
{
	let sides: Int
	let generator: RandomNumberGenerator
	init(sides: Int, generator: RandomNumberGenerator)
	{
		self.sides = sides
		self.generator = generator
	}
	
	func roll() -> Int
	{
		return Int(generator.random() * Double(sides)) + 1
	}
}
```

Just for fun, let's roll a few:
```swift
let d6 = Dice(sides: 6, generator: generator)
d6.roll()
d6.roll()
d6.roll()
d6.roll()
d6.roll()
d6.roll()
```

## Adding Protocol Conformance with an Extension

Existing classes, structures and enumerations can be extended to conform to a given protocol.

Let's start with a simple protocol we'll use for expirimentation:
```swift
protocol TextRepresentable
{
	func asText() -> String
}
```

We'll extend our Dice class:
```swift
extension Dice: TextRepresentable
{
	func asText() -> String
	{
		return "A \(sides)-sided dice"
	}
}
```

Existing instances (such as 'd6' will automatically adopt and conform to the new protocol, even though it was declared prior to the extension.
```swift
d6.asText()
```

## Declaring Protocol Adoption with an Extension

Some types may already adopt a protocol, but do not state so in their definition. Types do not automatically adopt to protocols whose requirements they satisfy - protocol adoption must always be stated explicitly.

This can be resolved with by using an empty extension.

To showcase this, let's create a structure that conforms to the TextRepresentable protocol, but doesn't include this as part of the definition:
```swift
struct Hamster
{
	var name: String
	func asText() -> String
	{
		return "A hamster named \(name)"
	}
}
```

Let's verify our work:
```swift
let tedTheHamster = Hamster(name: "Ted")
tedTheHamster.asText()
```

We can add TextRepresentable conformance to Hamster by using an empty extension.

This works because the requirements are already met, so we don't need to include any additional functionality within the extension definition.
```swift
extension Hamster: TextRepresentable
{
	
}
```

## Collections of Protocol Types

Hamsters and Dice don't have much in common, but in our sample code above, they both conform to the TextRepresentable protocol. Because of this, we can create an array of things that are TextRepresentable which includes each:
```swift
let textRepresentableThigns: [TextRepresentable] = [d6, tedTheHamster]
```

We can now loop through each and produce its text representation:
```swift
for thing in textRepresentableThigns
{
	thing.asText()
}
```

## Protocol Inheritance

Protocols can inherit from other protocols in order to add further requirements. The syntax for this is similar to a class ineriting from its superclass.

Let's create a new text representable type, inherited from TextRepresentable:
```swift
protocol PrettyTextRepresentable: TextRepresentable
{
	func asPrettyText() -> String
}
```

Let's make our Dice a little prettier.

Note that the Dice already knows that it conforms to the TextRepresentable, which means we can call asText() inside our asPrettyText() method.
```swift
extension Dice: PrettyTextRepresentable
{
	func asPrettyText() -> String
	{
		return "The pretty version of " + asText()
	}
}
```

We can test our work:
```swift
d6.asPrettyText()
```

## Protocol Composition

Protocols can be combined such that a type conforms to each of them. For example, a person can be an aged person as well as a named person.

Protocol Composition is a syntactic method of declaring that an instance conforms to a set of protocols. It takes the form "protocol<SomeProtocol, AnotherProtocol>". There can be as many protocols between the angle brackets as you need.

Let's start by creating a couple of protocols for expirimentation:
```swift
protocol Named
{
	var name: String { get }
}
protocol Aged
{
	var age: Int { get }
}
```

Here, we declare an Individual that conforms to both Name and Age protocols:
```swift
struct Individual: Named, Aged
{
	var name: String
	var age: Int
}
```

Here, we can see the protocol composition at work as the parameter into the wishHappyBirthday() function:
```swift
func wishHappyBirthday(celebrator: protocol<Named, Aged>) -> String
{
	return "Happy Birthday \(celebrator.name) - you're \(celebrator.age)!"
}
```

If we call the member, we can see the celebratory wish for this individual:
```swift
wishHappyBirthday(Individual(name: "Bill", age: 31))
```

## Checking for Protocol Conformance

We can use 'is' and 'as' for testing for protocol conformance, just as we've seen in the section on Type Casting.

In order for this to work with protocols, they must be marked with an "@objc" attribute. See further down in this playground for a special note about the @objc attribute.

Let's create a new protocol with the proper prefix so that we can investigate:
```swift
@objc protocol HasArea
{
	var area: Double { get }
}

class Circle: HasArea
{
	let pi = 3.14159
	var radius: Double
	var area: Double { return pi * radius * radius }
	init(radius: Double) { self.radius = radius }
}
class Country: HasArea
{
	var area: Double
	init(area: Double) { self.area = area }
}
class Animal
{
	var legs: Int
	init(legs: Int) { self.legs = legs }
}
```

We can store our objects into an array of type AnyObject[]
```swift
let objects: [AnyObject] =
[
	Circle(radius: 3.0),
	Country(area: 4356947.0),
	Animal(legs: 4)
]
```

Then we can test each for conformance to HasArea:
```swift
objects[0] is HasArea
objects[1] is HasArea
objects[2] is HasArea
```

## Optional Protocol Requirements

Sometimes it's convenient to declare protocols that have one or more requirements that are optional. This is done by prefixing those requirements with the 'optional' keyword.

The term "optional protocol" refers to protocols that are optional in a very similar since to optionals we've seen in the past. However, rather than stored values that can be nil, they can still use optional chaining and optional binding for determining if an optional requirement has been satisfied and if so, using that requirement.

As with Protocol Conformance, a protocol that uses optional requirements must also be prefixed with the '@objc' attribute.

A special note about @objc attribute:
- In order to check if an instance of a class conforms to a given protocol, that protocol must be declared with the @objc attribute.
- This is also the case with optional requirements in protocols. In order to use the optional declaration modifier, the protocol must be declared with the @objc attribute.
- Additionally, any class, structure or enumeration that owns an instance that conforms to a protocol declared with the @objc attribute must also be declared with the @objc attribute.

Here's another simple protocol that uses optional requrements:
```swift
@objc protocol CounterDataSource
{
	optional func incrementForCount(count: Int) -> Int
	optional var fixedIncrement: Int { get }
}
```

In the class below, we'll see that checking to see if an instance conforms to a specific requirement is similar to checking for (and accessing) optionals. We'll use optional chaining for these optional reqirements:
```swift
@objc class Counter
{
	var count = 0
	var dataSource: CounterDataSource?
	func increment()
	{
		// Does the dataSource conform to the incrementForCount method?
		if let amount = dataSource?.incrementForCount?(count)
		{
			count += amount
		}
		// If not, does it conform to the fixedIncrement variable requirement?
		else if let amount = dataSource?.fixedIncrement?
		{
			count += amount
		}
	}
}
```
