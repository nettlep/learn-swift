# Assertions

## Things to know:
- Assertions only trigger in debug mode and not in published builds
- Assertions cause your app to terminate on the line and the debugger jumps to the line

------

Let's start with a value...
```swift
let age = 3
```

You can assert with a message
```swift
assert(age >= 0, "A person's age cannot be negative")
```

You can assert without the message
```swift
assert(age >= 0)
```
