# Optionals

## Things to know:

- An optional value is a stored value that can either hold a value or "no value at all"
- This is similar to assigning a stored value to "nil" but Optionals work with any type of stored value, including Int, Bool, etc.

-----

An optional declaration adds a "?" immediately after the explicit type. The following line defines a value 'someOptional' that can either hold an Int or no value at all. In this case we set an optional Int value to .None (similar to nil)

```swift
let someOptional: Int? = nil
```

Let's try to convert a String to an Int. Using the String's toInt() method, we'll try to convert a string to a numeric value. Since not all strings can be converted to an Integer, the toInt() returns an optional, "Int?". This way we can recognize failed conversions without having to trap exceptions or use other arcane methods to recognize the failure.

Here's an optional in action

```swift
let notNumber = "abc"
let failedConversion = notNumber.toInt()
```

Notice how failedConversion is 'nil', even though it's an Int
```swift
failedConversion
```

Let's carry on with a successful conversion
```swift
let possibleNumber = "123"
var optionalConvertedNumber = possibleNumber.toInt()
```

This one worked
```swift
optionalConvertedNumber
```

If we assign it to a constant, the type of that constant will be an Optional Int (Int?)
```swift
let unwrapped = optionalConvertedNumber // 'unwrapped' is another optional
```

## Alternate syntax for Optionals

The use of a "?" for the syntax of an optional is syntactic sugar for the use of the Generic Optional type defined in Swift's standard library. We haven't gotten into Generics yet, but let's not let that stop us from learning this little detail.

These two lines are of equivalent types:
```swift
let optionalA: String? = .None
let optionalB: Optional<String> = .None
```

## Unwrapping

The difference between Int and Int? is important. Optionals essentially "wrap" their contents which means that Int and Int? are two different types (with the latter being wrapped in an optional.

We can't explicity convert to an Int because that's not the same as an Int?. The following line won't compile:
```swift
// let unwrappedInt: Int = optionalConvertedNumber
```

One way to do this is to "force unwrap" the value using the "!" symbol, like this:
```swift
let unwrappedInt = optionalConvertedNumber!
```

Implicit unwrapping isn't very safe because if the optional doesn't hold a value, it will generate a runtime error. To verify that is's safe, you can check the optional with an if statement.
```swift
if optionalConvertedNumber != .None
{
	// It's now safe to force-unwrap because we KNOW it has a value
	let anotherUnwrappedInt = optionalConvertedNumber!
}
else
{
	// The optional holds "no value"
	"Nothing to see here, go away"
}
```

## Optional Binding

We can conditionally store the unwrapped value to a stored value if the optional holds a value.

In the following block, we'll optionally bind the Int value to a constant named 'intValue'
```swift
if let intValue = optionalConvertedNumber
{
	// No need to use the "!" suffix as intValue is not optional
	intValue
	
	// In fact, since 'intValue' is an Int (not an Int?) we can't use the force-unwrap. This line
	// of code won't compile:
	// intValue!
}
else
{
	// Note that 'intValue' doesn't exist in this "else" scope
	"No value"
}
```

We can still use optional binding to bind to another optional value, if we do so explicitly by specifying the type of the stored value that we're binding to.
```swift
if let optionalIntValue:Int? = optionalConvertedNumber
{
	// 'optionalIntValue' is still an optional, but it's known to be safe. We can still check
	// it here, though, because it's still an optional. If it weren't optional, this if statement
	// wouldn't compile:
	if optionalIntValue != .None
	{
		// 'optionalIntValue' is optional, so we still use the force-unwrap here:
		"intValue is optional, but has the value \(optionalIntValue!)"
	}
}
```

Setting an optional to 'nil' sets it to be contain "no value"
```swift
optionalConvertedNumber = nil
```

Now if we check it, we see that it holds no value:
```swift
if optionalConvertedNumber != .None
{
	"optionalConvertedNumber holds a value (\(optionalConvertedNumber))! (this should not happen)"
}
else
{
	"optionalConvertedNumber holds no value"
}
```

We can also try optional binding on an empty optional
```swift
if let optionalIntValue = optionalConvertedNumber
{
	"optionalIntValue holds a value (\(optionalIntValue))! (this should not happen)"
}
else
{
	"optionalIntValue holds no value"
}
```

Because of the introduction of optionals, you can no longer use nil for non-optional variables or constants.

The following line will not compile
```swift
// var failure: String = nil // Won't compile
```

The following line will compile, because the String is optional
```swift
var noString: String? = nil
```

If we create an optional without an initializer, it is automatically initialized to nil. In future sections, we'll learn that all values must be initialized before they are used. Because of this behavior, this variable is considered initialized, even though it holds no value:
```swift
var emptyOptional: String?
```

Another way to implicitly unwrap an optional is during declaration of a new stored value

Here, we create an optional that we are pretty sure will always hold a value, so we give Swift permission to automatically unwrap it whenever it needs to.

Note the type, "String!"
```swift
var assumedString: String! = "An implicitly unwrapped optional string"
```

Although assumedString is still an optional (and can be treated as one), it will also automatically unwrap if we try to use it like a normal String.

Note that we perform no unwrapping in order to assign the value to a normal String
```swift
let copyOfAssumedString: String = assumedString
```

Since assumedString is still an optional, we can still set it to nil. This is dangerous to do because we assumed it is always going to hold a value (and we gave permission to automatically unwrap it.) So by doing this, we are taking a risk:
```swift
assumedString = nil
```

BE SURE that your implicitly unwrapped optionals actually hold values!

The following line will compile, but will generate a runtime error because of the automatic unwrapping.
```swift
// let errorString: String = assumedString
```

Like any other optional, we can still check if it holds a value:
```swift
if (assumedString != nil)
{
	"We have a value"
}
else
{
	"No value"
}
```
