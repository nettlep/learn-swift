# Basic Operations

## Things to know:
- Assuming knowledge of C here, so a lot will be left out that is the the same, such as "let i = 1 + 2"
- Unary operators work on a single target. Of them, you have prefix operators such as !b or postfix operators such as i++.
- Binary operators work on two targets and are infix operators because they go between two values, such as a + b
- Ternary operators work on three targets. There is only one ternary: a ? b : c.

We have our standard assignment operator (=). Note that the assignment operator in Swift does
not actually return a value, so the statment "if (x = y) {}" will not work. This helps prevent
accidental assignments during conditionals.
```swift
var a = 10.0
var b = 3.0
```

Assignment can also take multiple values (for Tuples):
```swift
let (x, y) = (5, 6)
x
y
```

Aside from the standard mathematics operators (+, -, /, *), there is also the remainder operator (%) which is not to be confused with modulo. They work differently because of the way remainders are calculated for negative numbers and can be used with floating point values.
```swift
var c = a / b // Floatng point result
var d = a % b // Floating point remainder
```

## Range operators

The range operator with two dots means up to but NOT including the final value.

This is called the "Half-Closed Range Operator"
```swift
for i in 1..<10
{
	i // prints 1 through 9
}
```

The range operator with three dots is inclusive with last value like

This is called the "Closed Range Operator"
```swift
for i in 1...10
{
	i // prints 1 through 10
}
```

## Unary, Binary and Ternary operators

Unary prefix operators appear before their taget. Here we increment a then negate it:
```swift
++a
a = -a
```

You can also use the uniary + operator, though it doesn't do anything
```swift
a = +a
```

We have the compound assigment operator
```swift
a += 10
```

The logical NOT
```swift
var truefalse = true
truefalse = !truefalse
```

Unary postfix operators appear after their target: i++
```swift
a--
a
```

Binary operators are infix because they appear between to targets
```swift
a + b
```

String concatenation uses the + operator:
```swift
"hello, " + "world"
```

You can add characters, too, which form a string
```swift
let dog: Character = "🐶"
let cow: Character = "🐮"
let dogCow = dog + cow
```

You can also add characters to a string
```swift
let str = "abc"
let chr: Character = "d"
String(chr) + str + String(chr)
```

Ternary operators work on three targets:
```swift
truefalse ? a : b
```

## Identity operators

We can test if the object reference refers to the same instance of an object (as opposed to two objects that are "equivalent" based on some compare logic.) We do this with the === operator:
```swift
class myclass {}
var c1 = myclass()
var c2 = myclass()
c1 === c2
c1 === c1
```

String comparisons are case sensitive
```swift
"abc" == "abc"
"abc" == "ABC"
```

## Logical operators

Comparisons use the logical operators with AND, OR and NOT
```swift
if (true && false) || !(false && true)
{
	"true"
}
```
