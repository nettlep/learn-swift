# Control Flow

## Things to know:

- Much of the control flow in Swift is similar to C-like languages, but there are some key differences. For example, switch-case constructs are much more flexible and powerful as well as extensions to break and continue statements.

----------

## For loops

We can loop through ranges using the closed-range operator ("...").

In the loop below, 'index' is a constant that is automatically declared.
```swift
for index in 1...5
{
	"This will print 5 times"
	
	// Being a constant, the following line won't compile:
	//
	// index = 99
}
```

The constant 'index' from the previous loop is scoped only to the loop. As a result, you cannot access it beyond the loop. The following line will not compile:
```swift
// index = 0
```

We can loop through ranges using the half-closed range operator ("..<")

We can also reuse the name 'index' because of the scoping noted previously.
```swift
for index in 1 ..< 5
{
	"This will print 4 times"
}
```

Apple's "Swift Programming Language" book states the following, which I find in practice to be incorrect:

“The index constant exists only within the scope of the loop. If you want to check the value of index after the loop completes, or if you want to work with its value as a variable rather than a constant, you must declare it yourself before its use in the loop.”

In practice, I find that the loop constant overrides any local variable/constant and maintains its scope to the loop and does not alter the locally defined value:
```swift
var indx = 3999
for indx in 1...5
{
	indx // This ranges from 1 to 5, inclusive

	// 'indx' is still acting like a constant, so this line won't compile:
	//
	// indx++
}
```

After the loop, we find that 'indx' still contains the original value of 3999
```swift
indx
```

We can use an underscore if you don't need access to the loop constant:
```swift
for _ in 1...10
{
	println("do something")
}
```

We can iterate over arrays
```swift
let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
for name in names
{
	name
}
```

We can iterate over a Dictionary's key/value pairs
```swift
let numberOfLegs = ["Spider":8, "Ant":6, "Cat":4]
for (animalName, legs) in numberOfLegs
{
	animalName
	legs
}
```

We can iterate over characters in a String
```swift
for character in "Hello"
{
	character
}
```

We can use the For-Condition-Increment loop construct, which resembles the C-like variant

Note that the loop value is a variable, not a constant. In fact, they cannot be constant because of the increment statement (++index)
```swift
for (var index = 0; index < 3; ++index)
{
	index
}
```

The parenthesis are optional for the For-Condition-Increment loop:
```swift
for var index = 0; index < 3; ++index
{
	index
}
```

Variables are scoped to the For-Condition-Increment construct. To alter this, pre-declare index
```swift
var index = 3000
for index = 0; index < 3; ++index
{
	index
}
index // Index holds 3 after running through the loop
```

## While loops

While loops resemble other C-like languages. They perform the condition before each iteration
through the loop:
```swift
while index > 0
{
	--index
}
```

Do-While loops also resemble their C-like language counterparts. They perform the condition after each iteration through the loop. As a result, they always execute the code inside the loop at least once:
```swift
do
{
	++index
} while (index < 3)
```

## Conditional Statements

The if statement is very similar to C-like languages, except that the parenthesis are optional. You can also chain multiple conditions with 'else' and 'else if' statements:
```swift
if (index > 0)
{
	"Index is positive"
}
else if index == 0
{
	"index is zero"
}
else
{
	"index is negative"
}
```

Switch statements are more powerful than their C-like counterparts. Here are a few of those differences to get us started:

Unlike C-like languages, switch statements do not require a "break" statement to prevent falling through to the next case.

Additionally, multiple conditions can be separated by a comma for a single case to match multiple conditions.

Switch statements must also be exhaustive and include all possible values, or the compiler will generate an error.

There are many more differences, but let's start with a simple switch statement to get our feet wet:
```swift
let someCharacter: Character = "e"
switch someCharacter
{
	case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u":
		"a vowel"
	
	case "b", "c", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "v", "w", "x", "u", "z":
		"a consonant"

	// Necessary because switch statements must be exhaustive in order to capture all Characters
	default:
		"not a vowel or consonant"
}
```

Each case clause must have a statement of some kind. A comment will not suffice.

Otherwise you will get a compilation error. The following won't compile because there is an empty case statement:
```swift
/* let anotherCharacter: Character = "a"
switch anotherCharacter
{
	case "a":
	case "A":
		"the letter a"
	default:
		"not the letter a"
} */
```

We can perform range matching for cases:
```swift
let count = 3_000_000_000_000
switch count
{
	case 0:
		"no"
	case 1...3:
		"a few"
	case 4...9:
		"several"
	case 10...99:
		"tens of"
	case 100...999:
		"hundreds of"
	case 1000...999999:
		"thousands of"
	default:
		"millions and millions of"
}
```

Matching against tuples

In addition to matching Tuples, we can also use ranges inside Tuple values and even match against partial Tuple values by using an "_" to ignore matches against a specific value within the Tuple.
```swift
let somePoint = (1,1)
switch somePoint
{
	case (0,0):
		"origin"
	
	// Match only against y=0
	case (_, 0):
		"On the X axis"
	
	// Match only against x=0
	case (0, _):
		"On the y axis"
	
	// Match x and y from -2 to +2 (inclusive)
	case (-2...2, -2...2):
		"On or inside the 2x2 box"
	
	// Everything else
	default:
		"Outisde the 2x2 box"
}
```

Value bindings in switch statements
```swift
var anotherPoint = (2, 8)
switch anotherPoint
{
	// Bind 'x' to the first value (matching any x) of the tuple and match on y=0
	case (let x, 0):
		"On the x axis with an x value of \(x)"
	
	// Bind 'y' to the second value (matching any y) of the tuple and match against x=0
	case (0, let y):
		"On the y axis with an y value of \(y)"
	
	// Bind both values of the tuple, matching any x or y. Note the shorthand of the 'let'
	// outside of the parenthesis. This works with 'var' as well.
	//
	// Also notice that since this matches any x or y, we fulfill the requirement for an exhaustive
	// switch.
	case let (x, y):
		"Somewhere else on \(x), \(y)"
}
```

We can also mix let/var for case statements. The following code block is the same as the previous except that the final case statement, which mixes variable and constants for the x and y components of the Tuple.
```swift
switch anotherPoint
{
	case (let x, 0):
		"On the x axis with an x value of \(x)"
	
	case (0, let y):
		"On the y axis with an y value of \(y)"
	
	case (var x, let y):
		++x // We can modify the variable 'x', but not the constant 'y'
		"Somewhere else on \(x), \(y)"
}
```

Where clauses allow us to perform more detailed conditions on case conditions. The where clauses work on the values declared on the case line:
```swift
let yetAnotherPoint = (1, -1)
switch yetAnotherPoint
{
	case let (x, y) where x == y:
		"On the line of x == y"
	
	case let (x, y) where x == -y:
		"On the line of x == -y"
	
	case let (x, y):
		"Just some arbitrary point"
}
```

## Control transfer statements

Swift supports extended versions of continue and break as well as an additional 'fallthrough' statement for switch-case constructs.

Since swift doesn't require a break statement to avoid falling through to the next case, we can still use them to early-out of the current case without continuing work. The first statement after the 'break' will be the next statement following the entire switch construct.
```swift
let someValue = 9000
switch someValue
{
	case let x where (x & 1) == 1:
		if someValue < 100
		{
			"Odd number less than 100"
			break
		}
		"Odd number greater or equal to 100"
		
	case let x where (x & 1) == 0:
		if someValue < 100
		{
			"Even number less than 100"
			break
		}
		"Even number greater or equal to 100"
	
	default:
		"Unknown value"
}
```

Since each case must have a statement and since we must have an exhaustive switch, we can use the break statement to effectively nullify the use of a case:
```swift
switch someValue
{
	case Int.min...100:
		"Small number"
	
	case 101...1000:
		break // We don't care about medium numbers
	
	case 1001...100_00:
		"Big number"
	
	default:
		break // We don't care about the rest, either
}
```

Since we don't need to break out of cases to avoid falling through automatically, we must specifically express our intention to fall through using the 'fallthrough' keyword
```swift
let integerToDescribe = 5
var integerDescription = "\(integerToDescribe) is"
switch integerToDescribe
{
	case 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19:
		integerDescription += " a prime number, and also"
		fallthrough
	
	default:
		integerDescription += " an integer."
}
```

Continue and Break statements have been extended in Swift to allow each to specify which switch or loop construct to break out of, or continue to.

To enable this, labels are used, similar to labels used by C's goto statement.

The following will print each name until it reaches the letter 'a' then skip to the next name
```swift
var result = ""
nameLoop: for name in names
{
	characterLoop: for character in name
	{
		theSwitch: switch character
		{
			case "a":
				// Break out of the theSwitch and characterLoop
				break characterLoop
			
			default:
				result += String(character)
		}
	}
}
result
```

Similarly, this prints all names without the letter 'a' in them:
```swift
result = ""
nameLoop: for name in names
{
	characterLoop: for character in name
	{
		theSwitch: switch character
		{
			case "a":
				// Continue directly to the character loop, bypassing this character in this name
				continue characterLoop
			
			default:
				result += String(character)
		}
	}
}
result
```

Similarly, this prints all names until the letter 'x' is found, then aborts all processing by breaking out of the outer loop:
```swift
result = ""
nameLoop: for name in names
{
	characterLoop: for character in name
	{
		theSwitch: switch character
		{
			case "x":
				// Break completely out of the outer name loop
				break nameLoop
			
			default:
				result += String(character)
		}
	}
}
result
```
