# Initialization

## Things to know:

- Swift provides an initializer (which partially resembles a function) to ensure that every property in a class, structure or enumeration is fully initialized.
- Optionals do not need to be initialized as they are automatically initialized to nil if no default value is provided.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a basic use of an initializer.

The Fahrenheit class will create a 'temperature' property that does not have a default value. Because there is no default value, the property must be initialized in the initializer.

Without the initializer, we would get an error whenever we tried to instantiate the Fahrenheit class.
```swift
struct Fahrenheit
{
	var temperature: Double

	init()
	{
		temperature = 32.0
	}
}
```

Since the class can fully initialize itself, we can safely instantiate it with no error:
```swift
var f = Fahrenheit()
```

Since the temperature is always defined as "32.0", it is cleaner and preferred to use a default value instead of setting it inside the initializer:
```swift
struct AnotherFahrenheit
{
	var temperature: Double = 32.0
}
```

Initializers can also include parameters. Here's an example of using a parameter to initialize the class's temperature to a given value.

The following class contains two initializers:
```swift
struct Celsius
{
	var temperatureInCelsius: Double = 0.0
	
	// Initialize our temperature from Fahrenheit
	init(fromFahrenheit fahrenheit: Double)
	{
		temperatureInCelsius = (fahrenheit - 32.0) / 1.8
	}
	
	// Initialize our temperature from Kelvin
	init(kelvin: Double)
	{
		temperatureInCelsius = kelvin - 273.15
	}
}
```

Now let's try our new initializers
```swift
let boilingPotOfWater = Celsius(fromFahrenheit: 212.0)
let freezingPointOfWater = Celsius(kelvin: 273.15)
```

External parameter names are automatically generated for the initializer. In order to opt-out of this automated convenience, you can specify "_" for the extnenal name explicitly.

Here's a class that defines two initializers - one that makes use of the automatic external name generation and one that opts out:
```swift
struct Color
{
	let red = 0.0, green = 0.0, blue = 0.0
	
	// This initializer will make use of automatically generated exernal names
	init(red: Double, green: Double, blue: Double)
	{
		self.red = red
		self.green = green
		self.blue = blue
	}
	
	// This initializer opts out by explicitly declaring external names with "_"
	init(_ red: Double, _ blue: Double)
	{
		self.red = red
		self.green = 0
		self.blue = blue
	}
}
```

Here, we can see our efforts pay off:
```swift
let magenta = Color(red: 1.0, green: 0.0, blue: 1.0)
let purple = Color(1.0, 0.5)
```

Optional properties do not need to be initialized:
```swift
class SurveyQuestion
{
	var text: String
	
	// Response is optional, and is automatically initialized to nil
	var response: String?

	init(text: String)
	{
		// We only need to initialize 'text'
		self.text = text
	}
	
	func ask() -> String
	{
		return text
	}
}
```

Constants need initialization as well. In the following example, our constant has a default value. However, if we initialize the class with the init(text: String) initializer, we can modify the default value to use the one passed in:
```swift
class SurveyQuestion2
{
	// Default value of "No question"
	let text: String = "No question"
	
	var response: String?
	
	init(text: String)
	{
		// Initializing the constant, 'text', even though it has a default value, we can modify
		// that default value here
		self.text = text
	}
	
	init()
	{
		// We do nothing here and let the default value for 'text' define its value
	}
	
	func ask() -> String
	{
		return text
	}
}
```

Here, we initialize the class with a blank initializer (calling init()) to let text's default value initialize the stored value
```swift
let noQuestion = SurveyQuestion2()
```

Here, we'll us an aalternat initializer to specify a different value for 'text'
```swift
let beetsQuestion = SurveyQuestion2(text: "Do you like beets?")
```

## Default Initializer

If all properties have default values (including optionals defaulting to nil) AND you do not create your own initlializer AND there is no superclass, Swift will create a default initializer (with no parameters) for you. This initializer sets all properties to their default values.

If you create your own initializer, Swift will not create the default initializer. If you want your custom initializers as well as the default initializer, then put your initializers in an extension.
```swift
class ShoppingListItem
{
	var name: String?
	var quantity = 1
	var purchased = false
	
	// No init(...) initializer
}
```

## Memberwise Initializers for Structure Types

Similar to the default initializer for classes, structures that do not implement an initializer but have default values for their stored properties will get a default memberwise initializer.

As with classes, if you want your custom initializers as well as the default memberwise initializer, then put your initializers in an extension.
```swift
struct Size
{
	var width = 0.0
	var height = 0.0
}
```

Here, we call the default memberwise initializer that Swift created for us
```swift
let twoByTwo = Size(width: 2.0, height: 2.0)
```

## Initializer Delegatgion for Value Types

Sometimes, it's convenient to have multiple initializers that call other initializers to do some of the heavy lifting.

In the following example, we have a class 'Rect' that has multiple initializers. One that initializes our rect given an origin and size, while another that calls upon the origin/size initializer from calculations based on the a center point.

This concept is further extended in "Initializer Chaining", covered later.
```swift
struct Point
{
	var x = 0.0
	var y = 0.0
}

struct Rect
{
	var origin = Point()
	var size = Size()
	
	// We create a basic initializer to use the default values Since we define other initializers,
	// the system won't create this for us, so we need to define it ourselves. Since we're using
	// the defaults, it is an empty closure.
	init() {}
	
	// Init from origin/size
	init(origin: Point, size: Size)
	{
		self.origin = origin
		self.size = size
	}
	
	// Init from center/size - note how we use the init(origin:size) to  perform actual
	// initialization
	init(center: Point, size: Size)
	{
		let originX = center.x - size.width / 2
		let originY = center.y - size.height / 2
		self.init(origin: Point(x: originX, y: originY), size: size)
	}
}
```

Here, we call the three initializers:
```swift
let basicRect = Rect()
let originRect = Rect(origin: Point(x: 2.0, y: 2.0), size: Size(width: 5.0, height: 5.0))
let centerRect = Rect(center: Point(x: 4.0, y: 4.0), size: Size(width: 3.0, height: 3.0))
```
