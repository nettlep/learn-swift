# Tuples

## Things to know:

- Tuples are groups of values combined into a single, compound value

-----

## Defining a Tuple
Use parenthesis around the comma-delimited list of values

This Tuple doesn't specify types, so it relies on inference

```swift
let httpError404 = (404, "Not found")
```

We can also specify the type in order to avoid inferrence

```swift
let someOtherTuple = (Double(100), Bool(false))
let a: (Double, Bool) = (100, false)
```

## Decomposing tuples

Decomposing tuples looks like this

```swift
let (statusCode, statusMessage) = httpError404
statusCode
statusMessage
```

We can also decompose into variables instead of constants, but you probably figured that out

```swift
var (varStatusCode, varStatusMessage) = httpError404
varStatusCode
varStatusMessage
```

You can also access them with the dot operator followed by their index:

```swift
httpError404.0
httpError404.1
```

## Named tuples

Alternatively, you can name the elements of a Tuple

```swift
let namedTuple = (statusCode: 404, message: "Not found")
```

When you name the elements you effectively assign names to their indices, so the dot operator works with names or integers:

```swift
namedTuple.statusCode == namedTuple.0
namedTuple.message == namedTuple.1
```
