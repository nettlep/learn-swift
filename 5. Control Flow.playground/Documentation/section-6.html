    <p>Apple&#39;s &quot;Swift Programming Language&quot; book states the following, which I find in practice to be incorrect:</p>
<p>“The index constant exists only within the scope of the loop. If you want to check the value of index after the loop completes, or if you want to work with its value as a variable rather than a constant, you must declare it yourself before its use in the loop.”</p>
<p>In practice, I find that the loop constant overrides any local variable/constant and maintains its scope to the loop and does not alter the locally defined value:</p>
