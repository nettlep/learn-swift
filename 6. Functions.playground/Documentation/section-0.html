<ul>
<li>Like most other languages, functions contain units of code to perform a task, but there are a few key featurs of functions in Swift.</li>
<li>Functions are types in Swift. This means that a function can receive another function as an input parameter or return a function as a result. You can even declare variables that are functions.</li>
<li>Functions can be nested, and the inner function can be returned by the outer function. To enable this, the current state of any local variables (local to the outer function) that are used by the inner function are &quot;captured&quot; for use by the inner function. Any time that inner function is called, it uses this captured state. This is the case even when a nested function is returned by the parent function.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Here&#39;s a simple function that receives a Single string and returns a String</p>
<p>Note that each parameter has a local name (for use within the function) and a standard type annotation. The return value&#39;s type is at the end of the function, following the -&gt;.</p>
