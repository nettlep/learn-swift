/* This is a comment

// The multi-line comments are handy because they can nest, which allows you to safely comment out
// blocks of code, even if they have multi-line comments in them:

/*
  // Some variable
  var someVar = 10

  /* A function
     *
     * This is a common way to comment functions, but it makes it difficult to comment out these
     * blocks.
