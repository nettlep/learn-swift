    <p>There is no length or count member of string, you have to use the global function, countElements()</p>
<p>This is much like calling strlen in which it iterates over the Unicode string and counts characters. Note that Unicode chars are different lenghts, so this is a non-trivial process.</p>
<p>“Note also that the character count returned by countElements is not always the same as the length property of an NSString that contains the same characters. The length of an NSString is based on the number of 16-bit code units within the string’s UTF-16 representation and not the number of Unicode characters within the string. To reflect this fact, the length property from NSString is called utf16count when it is accessed on a Swift String value.”</p>
