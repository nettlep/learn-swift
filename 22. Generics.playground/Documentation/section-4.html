    <p>The &#39;swapTwoValues()&#39; function is a generic function in a sense that some or all of the types that it works on are generic (i.e., specific only to the calls placed on that function.)</p>
<p>Study the first line of the function and notice the use of <T> and the type for &#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39; as type T. In this case, T is just a placeholder for a type and by studying this function, we can see that both &#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39; are the same type.</p>
<p>If we call this function with two Integers, it will treat the function as one declared to accept two Ints, but if we pass in two Strings, it will work on Strings.</p>
<p>If we study the body of the function, we&#39;ll see that it is coded in such a way as to work with any type passed in: The &#39;tmp&#39; parameter&#39;s type is inferred by the value &#39;a&#39; and &#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39; must be assignable. If any of this criteria are not met, a compilation error will appear for the function call the tries to call swapTwoValues() with a type that doesn&#39;t meet this criteria.</p>
<p>Although we&#39;re using T as the name for our type placeholder, we can use any name we wish, though T is a common placeholder for single type lists. If we were to create a new implementation of the Dictionary class, we would want to use two type parameters and name them effectively, such as <KeyType, ValueType>.</p>
<p>A type placholder can also be used to define the return type.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s call it a few times to see it in action:</p>
