<p>Most C++ programmers should be familiar with the concept of operator overloading. Swift offers the same kind of functionality as well as additional functionality of specifying the operator precednce and associativity.</p>
<p>The most common operators will usually take one of the following forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>prefix: the operator appears before a single identifier as in &quot;-a&quot; or &quot;++i&quot;</li>
<li>postfix: the operator appears after a single identifier as in &quot;i++&quot;</li>
<li>infix: the operator appears between two identifiers as in &quot;a + b&quot; or &quot;c / d&quot;</li>
