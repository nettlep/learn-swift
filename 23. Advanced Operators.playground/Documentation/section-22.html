    <p>Equivalence Operators allow us to define a means for checking if two values are the same or equivalent. They can be &quot;equal to&quot; (==) or &quot;not equal to&quot; (!=). These are simple infix opertors that return a Bool result.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s also take a moment to make sure we do this right. When comparing floating point values you can either check for exact bit-wise equality (a == b) or you can compare values that are &quot;very close&quot; by using an epsilon. It&#39;s important to recognize the difference, as there are cases when IEEE floating point values should be equal, but are actually represented differently in their bit-wise format because they were calculated differently. In these cases, a simple equality comparison will not suffice.</p>
<p>So here are our more robust equivalence operators:</p>
