<p>So far, we&#39;ve been defining operator functions for operators that Swift understands and for which Swift provides defined behaviors. We can also define our own custom operators for doing other interestig things.</p>
<p>For example, Swift doesn&#39;t support the concept of a &quot;vector normalization&quot; or &quot;cross product&quot; because this functionality doesn&#39;t apply to any of the types Swift offers.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s keep it simple, though. How about an operator that adds a vector to itself. Let&#39;s make this a prefix operator that takes the form &quot;+++value&quot;</p>
<p>First, we we must introduce Swift to our new operator. The syntax takes the form of the &#39;operator&#39; keyword, folowed by either &#39;prefix&#39;, &#39;postfix&#39; or &#39;infix&#39;:</p>
<p>Swift meet operator, operator meet swift:</p>
