    <p>Shifting in Swift is slightly different than in C++.</p>
<p>A lesser-known fact about C++ is that the signed right-shift of a signed value is implementation specific. Most compilers do what most programmers expect, which is an arithmetic shift (which maintains the sign bit and shifts 1&#39;s into the word from the right.)</p>
<p>Swift defines this behavior to be what you expect, shifting signed values to the right will perform an arithmetic shift using two&#39;s compilment.</p>
